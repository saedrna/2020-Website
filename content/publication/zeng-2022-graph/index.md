abstract: 'In complex and heterogeneous geoenvironments, landslides exhibit varying
  features in different environments, and data in landslide inventories are imbalanced.
  Existing data-driven landslide susceptibility evaluation (LSE) methods overlook
  environmental heterogeneity and cannot reliably predict regions with few samples.
  Alternatively, global random negative sampling strategies may produce imbalanced
  positive and negative samples in some environments, contributing to inaccurate predictions.
  This article proposes a graph neural network (GNN) constrained by environmental
  consistency (GNN-EC) to overcome these problems. The GNN-EC consists of graphs with
  nodes, and edges. A graph represents the environmental relationships in the study
  area. Nodes are geographic units delineated from terrain polygon approximation.
  Edges capture the relationships between node-pairs. Additionally, the weights of
  edges reflect the similarity between two node environments. A GNN aggregates node
  information in the graph for LSE. Our experiment showed that the proposed method
  outperformed the common machine learning methods: increasing prediction accuracy
  by approximately 7, 5– 6 and 3– 4% compared to the artificial neural network (ANN),
  the support vector machine (SVM) and the random forest (RF), respectively. Moreover,
  our method can maintain high prediction accuracy, even with a small training set.'
